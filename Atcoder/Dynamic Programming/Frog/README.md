## Problem Statement

### There are N stoned, numbered from 1 to N, For each i (1≤i≤N), the height of Stone i is hi.

### There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:
### * If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to Stone i + 1 or Stone i + 2. Here, a cost of |hi − hj| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.

### Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.
